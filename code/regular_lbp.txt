This implementation follows a basic approach to LBP computation with a circular sampling pattern. It calculates the binary patterns for each pixel in the image, excluding a border of radius R. The resulting lbp_img array represents the LBP values for each pixel in the original image.

LBP Computation:
    The nested loops iterate over the image pixels excluding a border of radius R. 
    For each pixel at (i, j), the code calculates the LBP value based on the pixel values in a circular neighborhood of radius R and with P sampling points.
    The neighborhood sampling is done using polar coordinates, where k iterates over the sampling points, and (x, y) is calculated using the polar coordinates. The pixel values are compared, and the binary pattern is constructed accordingly.
    The constructed pattern is assigned to the corresponding location in the lbp_img array.
